## Course description

This course serves as an introduction to the basic concepts of network security
with an emphasis on practical and development skills. Topics include denial of
service attacks and defenses, authentication, key distribution, message
authentication, access control, protocol security, virtual private networks, and
security standards. The course will provide a review of basic network design,
the end-to-end principle, and basic cryptography. Prerequisites: CSSE 220 or
approval of the instructor.

## Learning objectives

At the end of this class, you should be able to:

- Identify security vulnerabilities in network protocols and exploit them in a
  controlled environment.
- Actively engage in the design and protection of network components.
- Work in a team to produce a laboratory assignment that can be used by future
  students in the class, on a topic of your choice.
- Practice relaying learned concepts to other students by presenting your lab
  results in the classroom.

## Course delivery

This class will mostly be delivered via practical laboratory assignments that
you will be doing during and outside of class time. Therefore, class meeting
times will include a short lecture, a demo, and then time for you to work on
your labs and ask questions as you go on.

While doing the labs, you will answer a series of guided questions that will
allow you to finally define basic networking and security concepts, and then
stitch them together to form a coherent lecture.

### Peer teaching

In addition to lab quizzes/reports, you will be asked to work with a group of
your classmates to deliver a lecture to the other students, in which you
describe your findings as if you were the class instructor.

These peer teaching sessions will be graded by your instructor as well as your
peers in the classroom.

### Project

As part of the class, you will work with a group of classmates to design a
network security laboratory assignment. You are expected to design experiments
that can be used by your peers in the classroom to work through a security
concept and learn about it as they do the lab.

### [Tentative] Final exam

At the end of the quarter, depending on how many students are still registered,
you might be tasked with infiltrating an already established network. You will
be given an entry point into the network, along with a set of possible software
vulnerabilities. Your job would be to map out the network, hop through it, reach
a target server, and obtain a secret key from it.

Naturally, this would be more of a fun and informative exercise, and since it is
as of yet still tentative, it will share a small fraction of your final grade.

## Textbook

### Recommended textbook

### Supplemental textbook(s)

## Grading

Your grade is the class will mostly depend on your completing the labs, your
performance during peer teaching sessions, and your project. If we elect to hold
a final exam, it would take-home, and will have minimal impact on your final
grade.

### Grading breakdown

| Item                   | Weight |
