# For thursday:

1. Create and explore a stateful firewall that blocks all but established
   connections.
   - Check which connections can survive (i.e., kill telnet then start it
     again, can it still connect?)

2. Use SNAT to access another subnet that blocks traffic not generate on that
   subnet.

# Maybe do this on Friday?

3. Build a port knocking firewall.

4. Use ssh port forwarding to access a webserver through a firewall that blocks
   all but `ssh` connections.

5. Use a SOCKS proxy to access a remote webpage that is blocked by a firewall.
