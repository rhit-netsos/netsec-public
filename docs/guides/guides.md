# General lab setup guides
{: .no_toc }

Make sure to take a look at the instructions in here to setup your class
repository, get some familiarity with `vim` and `tmux`. I will keep updating
this page with any links or tutorials that I find useful (I also welcome
suggestions on what you think could be useful).

For setting yourself up with terminal emulator, I recommend a Linux terminal
running on  WSL2 if you are on Windows, and iterm2 if you are on mac. If you're
running Linux already, then you are good.

For setting up WSL2, please take a look at the instructions
[here](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/csse/csse132/2324a/labs/prelab1-wsl2.html)
from CSSE132. Specifically, look at the section considering installing WSL2 and
the Windows Terminal. You can use any distribution you prefer!
